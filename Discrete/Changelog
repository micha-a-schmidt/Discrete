* Discrete 1.1.5
* 2023-10-18
	- Added debugging code.
	- fixed bug in MBconvertMathematicaToGAP function: square roots and ratios
	were not correctly converted (thanks to Christian Doering for pointing it out.)
	- automatically remove warning messages at the beginning of GAP output in	readGAP function.
